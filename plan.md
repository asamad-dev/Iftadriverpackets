# Driver Packet Processing System - Comprehensive Plan

## üìã **Overview**
This system processes driver trip sheet images using Google's Gemini AI for intelligent OCR and data extraction, with comprehensive validation, correction, geocoding, and distance calculation capabilities.

## üéØ **Core Processing Steps**

### **Step 1: Image Analysis & Data Extraction**
- **Input**: Driver packet images from `@input` folder
- **Process**: Use Gemini API to extract handwritten text data
- **Technology**: Google Gemini 1.5-flash multimodal AI
- **Output**: Raw JSON data with extracted fields

### **Step 2: Comprehensive Data Validation & Correction**
- **Trailer Number Validation**: Ensure 200-299 range (fix hundreds digit)
- **Location Corrections**: Apply standardized location mappings
- **Date Format Standardization**: Convert all dates to MM/DD/YY format
- **Field Duplication Prevention**: Avoid copying values between fields
- **Drop-off Array Handling**: Parse multiple drop-offs separated by "to"
- **Total Miles Validation**: Check for reasonable values

### **Step 3: Geocoding (GPS Coordinates)**
- **Primary**: HERE Geocoding API (if available)
- **Fallback**: OpenStreetMap Nominatim API
- **Caching**: Avoid repeated API calls for same locations
- **Output**: Latitude/longitude coordinates for all locations

### **Step 4: Distance Calculations**
- **Method**: HERE Routing API (truck routing mode)
- **Process**: Calculate distances between consecutive stops
- **State Mileage**: Track mileage within each state
- **Route Analysis**: Full trip analysis with leg-by-leg breakdown

### **Step 5: Output Generation**
- **JSON Files**: Detailed results with all metadata
- **CSV Files**: Small table for each image with distance traveled in each state.
- **Timestamps**: Processing metadata for tracking

### **Step 6: Reporting & Validation**

# Fuel Table Extraction
UPDATE Prompt for GEMINI using following information related to fuel details table:

It should read fuel table the heading of table is "FUEL DETAILS", and extract Fuel Gallons and in which state it was filled.
It has following columns:
1. "Data/Invoice" or "Data/ Invoice"
2. "Vendor"
3. "City&State" or "City & State"
4. "# Gal."
5. "Price"
6. "Amount"
7. "CashAdv." or "Cash Adv."

Columns explanations
### 1. "Data/Invoice" or "Data/ Invoice"
It will be a date in which we are not interested, but some rows will be filed by three letters "DEF" if that is the case then we will take same date from one row above.
### 2. "Vendor"
Ignore this column.
### 3. "City&State" or "City & State"
We are very interested in State. Mostly there will be Initials of USA States but some times we might have full state name. If state name is not clear we can get the idea from city name or from the row above or below it. If no city and state is mentioned and any of other column show "DEF" then use the state from the above row. 
### 4. "# Gal."
It will be a number/quantity and we have to be very very accurate about reading it.
### 5. "Price"
Ignore this column.
### 6. "Amount"
Ignore this column.
### 7. "CashAdv." or "Cash Adv."
Ignore this column.

## Results 
A new sheet named "Gallon Trip Env" with following columns
1. "State" : State initials (two letters)
2. "Gallons" : Cumulative Sum of gallon per state
3. "Unit" : It is unit number whic is already extracted from image
4. "Trip (Page No.)" : Image number 

Basically we are calculating gallon per state for all different states in fuel details table.



# Different Input formats
Other then image we have few different formats that will not going to use gemini API 
ther are following 

## New format 1:
State,Country,Unit,Distance
AL,USA,1104,214 mi
AZ,USA,1104,1841 mi
CA,USA,1104,1033 mi

This is very very simple we just need to rearrange few column and we will get the output fast, 
if input file is like this then we will not calcualte gallon and not have gallon in results

## New format 2:
Card #,Tran Date,Invoice,Unit,Driver Name,Odometer,Location Name,City,State/ Prov,Fees,Item,Unit Price,Qty,Amt,DB,Currency
*0541,2025-01-09,13504,,JITENDER SINGH 10813697,0,TA ELOY,ELOY,AZ,0.00,ULSD,3.499,97.9,342.54,N,USD/Gallons
*0541,2025-01-09,13504,,JITENDER SINGH 10813697,0,TA ELOY,ELOY,AZ,0.00,DEFD,4.459,2.95,13.17,N,USD/Gallons

This will be same as 2nd one it will onyl give us gallons 
we have to get "Number of Tractor Gallons" field and "Truck Stop State" mainly 

## NEW format 4
we are going to have an .csv format in which first we have to search for headers 
some times these are on 1st row but some times these are on 3rd row (for example (test\input\csvFormat4\08.2 Quantum Jan to Sept 25-For Miles Update.xlsx - Sheet1.csv) )
In this we will have some key columns like
Load No, Shipper City,Shipper State,Delivery City,Delivery State
you will see that in input file Miles are empty.
now main thing to do is take each row as single input and take these column (Shipper City,Shipper State,Delivery City) and use here API to get the route and calcualte how many miles it traveled in each state, we have to use already present function in files like [src\route_analyzer.py](src\route_analyzer.py) and [src\state_analyzer.py](src\state_analyzer.py) and any other file related to HERE API. 
The process is simple in NEW format 4 take single row as input and calcualte miles in each state.
with respect to [streamlit_app.py](streamlit_app.py) we will not use result dashboard in this and display some results in export data UI tab but the output format will be xlsx and csv both and json could be empty.
we will only work with miles here and not with fuel gallons.

### Performance Optimization Features
Based on performance analysis (5067 routes in 2h 14min = 38 routes/min):

#### 1. Progressive Export Feature
- **Auto-save every 500 routes**: System automatically downloads partial CSV results every 500 processed routes
- **Resume capability**: If processing is interrupted, user can upload the partial result and system will detect completed routes
- **Battery protection**: Prevents data loss from laptop battery issues or crashes
- **Progress persistence**: Maintains processing state across interruptions

#### 2. Smart Re-processing Mode
When user uploads a CSV that already has State column with data:
- **Detection logic**: System detects if State column exists and has valid state abbreviations (CA, TX, NY, etc.)
- **Selective processing**: Only processes routes where:
  - State column is empty/blank
  - State column contains "WARNING" or "ERROR" or "FAILED"
  - State column has invalid values (not 2-letter state codes)
  - Multiple state entries exist for same Load No (indicating incomplete processing)
- **Skip completed routes**: Routes with valid state data are preserved and skipped
- **Merge results**: Combines existing valid data with newly calculated routes
- **Validation**: Ensures each Load No has multiple state entries as expected

#### 3. Failure Handling Strategy
For routes that fail distance calculation (~1% failure rate based on logs):
- **Retry logic**: 2-3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Fallback estimation**: Use straight-line distance √ó truck routing factor (1.3x)
- **Error categorization**: 
  - "No route found": Geographic/routing issues
  - "Distance calculation failed": API/service issues
  - "Missing location data": Data quality issues
- **Manual review queue**: Failed routes exported separately for manual processing

### output format for new format 4
for sample input 
Load No,PU Date,Del Date,Inv Date,Shipper City,Shipper State,Delivery City,Delivery State,Miles,Remarks
179758,11/04/24,11/10/24,01/02/25,MORENO VALLEY,CA,SAN ANTONIO ,TX,,
180442,12/06/24,12/12/24,01/02/25,MORENO VALLEY,CA,NEW BRAUNFELS ,TX,,

output will be 
Load No,PU Date,Del Date,Inv Date,Shipper City,Shipper State,Delivery City,Delivery State,State,Miles,Remarks
179758,11/04/24,11/10/24,01/02/25,MORENO VALLEY,CA,SAN ANTONIO ,TX, state 1, miles of state 1,,

180442,12/06/24,12/12/24,01/02/25,MORENO VALLEY,CA,NEW BRAUNFELS ,TX, state 6, miles of state 6,,

State column will be two letter for state like CA for california

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Progressive export every 500 routes
2. **Phase 2**: Smart re-processing mode for interrupted sessions
3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced failure handling with fallback estimation
4. **Phase 4**: Route caching and deduplication for performance

### Expected Performance Improvements
- **Progressive export**: 0% data loss from interruptions
- **Smart re-processing**: 50-90% time savings on resumed sessions
- **Failure handling**: 99.5%+ completion rate vs current 99.1%
- **Route caching**: 3-5x speed improvement for duplicate routes
